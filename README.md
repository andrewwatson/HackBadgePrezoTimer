# Presentation Timer

This firmware runs a Twilio HackBadge via Particle and displays green, yellow and red LEDs
to let a presenter know when their time is up.

## Usage

Call the Particle start() method to start the timer and the stop() method to stop it.  
Right now it doesn't matter what you pass to them as arguments...

## TODO

Make it possible to change the timer duration with the argument to the start function
